## Nepali Language Specifics (source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language))
Speakers: 32 million
Language Family: Indo Aryan family (more specifically, Eastern Pahari)
Currently majorly spoken in: Nepal, India (Sikkim, West Bengal)
Language code: ne, nep, npi
Script: Devangiri Script

## Old Nepali vs Modern Nepali
1. Old Nepali (Prachin Nepali)
- A version of Khasa Prakrit
- Heavily dependent on Classical Sanskrit
- It retained many formal or classical terms which are not common in modern usage
- Usually used in legal, religous or political documents
- Very complex in structure and high honorfics (formalities)
- Uses Devangiri Script variations and spellings

3. Modern Nepali
- The next step from Khasa Prakrit
- Has alot of similar words from Hindi, English too
- Has formalized and standardized variations and spellings whichsmakes it simpler

Note: Khara Prakrit is a language build from sanskrit
